# Chore Crew Organizer - Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the technical architecture for the Chore Crew Organizer application.

## System Overview

Chore Crew Organizer is a React-based web application for families to manage household chores and tasks. The application allows users to:

- Track family members
- Assign and monitor tasks/chores
- View tasks in a calendar format
- See statistics on task completion

## APIs and Data Management

### Current Implementation

1. **React State and Context API**
   - Used in `FamilyContext.tsx` for application state management
   - Manages family members and tasks data
   - Provides methods for adding, updating, and deleting tasks and family members

2. **Browser LocalStorage API**
   - Used to persist application data between sessions
   - Stores family data, tasks, and authentication state
   - Implementation in `FamilyContext.tsx` and `App.tsx`

3. **No External APIs**
   - The current implementation does not integrate with any external APIs
   - All data is managed locally within the browser

## Database Implementation

### Current Approach: Client-Side Storage

The application currently does not use a traditional database system. Instead:

- **LocalStorage as Data Store**:
  - Data is stored directly in the browser's localStorage
  - Provides persistence between page refreshes
  - Limited to a single device/browser

- **Mock Data**:
  - Initial data is provided by the `mockData.ts` service
  - Contains sample family members and tasks to demonstrate functionality

### Limitations of Current Approach

- Data is not synchronized across devices
- No backup capabilities
- Limited storage capacity (usually 5-10MB)
- No data validation or integrity checks beyond application code
- No query capabilities beyond what's implemented in application logic

## Authentication System

### Current Implementation: Mock Authentication

The current authentication system is a simple demonstration implementation:

- **Implementation Location**: 
  - `App.tsx` and `AuthPage.tsx`

- **Mechanism**:
  - Uses a boolean flag (`isAuthenticated`) stored in localStorage
  - No actual credential verification

- **Features**:
  - Demo login button that immediately authenticates users
  - Login/Signup forms that exist for UI purposes only
  - Authentication state persistence between browser sessions

### Authentication Limitations

The current implementation is for demonstration purposes only and lacks:
- Actual security - anyone can modify localStorage to "authenticate"
- User identity management
- Access control/permissions
- Session management
- Password protection

## Future Enhancements

### Database Improvements
- Implement a proper backend database (SQL or NoSQL)
- Add server-side validation
- Support multi-device synchronization
- Implement data backup and recovery

### Authentication Enhancements
- Integrate with an authentication provider (Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc.)
- Implement secure user registration and login
- Add password recovery functionality
- Implement role-based access control

### API Integration Opportunities
- Calendar service integration (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar)
- Notification services (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Cloud storage for family photos/avatars
- Task reminder integration

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm/bun

## Component Structure

- **Pages**: Main application views (Dashboard, Tasks, Calendar)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Context**: State management and business logic
- **Services**: Mock data and utilities
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions

This document will be updated as the architecture evolves.
